# Residential-Area-Transport-Management-System-in-JAVA
The transport management system is an application developed for a residential area. It is an application developed in Java which is used to store all the transport-related records. It stores information related to transports and their users. The purpose of developing such a system was to reduce the errors that occur in the manual system where it was very difficult to store the records. It also provides the facility to see the map of the residential area.

1.1 Document Convention         

   There will be two types of users for this system.  

                1. Admin 

                2. Public/general user  

The system is designed in a way that public users will be able to view some of the content or information of the system but only the admin will be able to access the core of the system and will be able to update information if necessary. To prevent illegal access, the admin will need to enter a password and will only be able to access admin power when his password will match with the admin password.  

 

 

1.2 Project Scope 

 

 The proposed system is developed to solve all the problems that occurred in the manual systems. This makes system secure and reliable. This system allows to maintain all the transport and their user information. So, everything becomes easy thus reducing the risks that come with an existing system. There are two types of login for this system the administrator, and general user login. The general users can view the details by logging with their details. This is created to handle all the transport-related information and save it in records.
